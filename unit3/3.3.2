;;================;;

;; area-circle: number -> number
;; to compute the area of a circle, given its radius
;; example: (area-circle 3) should produce 28.27
(define (area-circle radius)
  (* pi radius radius))
;; test:
(area-circle 3) "should produce" 28.27

;; volume-cylinder: number, number -> number
;; to compute the volume of a cylinder, given the radius of the cylinder's base disk and its height
;; example: (volume-cylinder 5 8) should produce 628.32
(define (volume-cylinder radius height)
  (* (area-circle radius) height))
;; test:
(volume-cylinder 5 8) "should produce" 628.32
