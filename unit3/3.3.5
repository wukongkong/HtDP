;; rocket-height: number, number -> number
;; to compute the height that a rocket reaches, given its constant acceration rate (g) and the time of the flight (t)
;; example: (rocket-height 2 10) should be 100
(define (rocket-height g t)
  (* 1/2 (rocket-speed g t) t))

;; rocket-speed: number, number -> number,
;; to compute the speed of a rocket, given its constant acceration rate (g) and the time of the flight (t)
;; example: (rocket-speed 2 10) should be 20
(define (rocket-speed g t)
  (* g t))

;; Tests:
(rocket-height 2 10) "should be" 100
(rocket-speed 2 10) "should be" 20
