;; interest: number -> number
;; to determine the amount of interest that money earns in a year for a given amount >= 0

;; EXAMPLES
;; (interest 0) should be 0
;; (interest 1000) should be 1000*0.040 = 40
;; (interest 5000) should be 5000*0.045 = 225
;; (interest 500) should be 500*0.040 = 20
;; (interest 2000) should be 2000*0.045 = 90
;; (interest 7000) should be 7000*0.050 = 350

  (cond
