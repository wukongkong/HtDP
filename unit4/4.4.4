;; how-many: number number number -> number
;; to determine how many solutions the equation axÂ²+bx+c=0 has, considering it is a proper quadratic equation (a=!0)

;; EXAMPLES
;; (how-many 1 0 -1) shold be 2
;; (how-many 2 4 2) shold be 1
;; (how-many 1 1 1) shold be 0

(define (how-many a b c)
  (cond
    [(> (* b b) (* 4 a c)) 2]
    [(= (* b b) (* 4 a c)) 1]
    [(< (* b b) (* 4 a c)) 0]))

;; EXAMPLES AS TESTS
(= (how-many 1 0 -1) 2)
(= (how-many 2 4 2) 1)
(= (how-many 1 1 1) 0)
