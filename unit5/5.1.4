;; Exercise 5.1.4 ;;
;;================;;

;; what-kind: number number number -> symbol
;; to determine whether a quadratic equation is degenerate and, if not, how many solutions the equation has, given its coefficients

;; EXAMPLES:
;; (what-kind 0 1 -1) "sould be" 'degenerate
;; (what-kind 1 0 -1) "sould be" 'two
;; (what-kind 2 4 2) "sould be" 'one
;; (what-kind 1 1 1) "sould be" 'none

(define (what-kind a b c)
  (cond
    [(= a 0) 'degenerate]
    [(> (* b b) (* 4 a c)) 'two]
    [(= (* b b) (* 4 a c)) 'one]
    [(< (* b b) (* 4 a c)) 'none]))

;; EXAMPLES AS TESTS:
(symbol=? (what-kind 0 1 -1) 'degenerate)
(symbol=? (what-kind 1 0 -1) 'two)
(symbol=? (what-kind 2 4 2) 'one)
(symbol=? (what-kind 1 1 1) 'none)
