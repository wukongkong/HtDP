;; check-colour: symbol symbol symbol symbol -> symbol
;; to cheack whether the colour guesses are correct or not

;; EXAMPLES:
;; (check-colour 'red 'blue 'red 'blue) should be 'Perfect
;; (check-colour 'red 'blue 'red 'green) should be 'OneColourAtCorrectPosition
;; (check-colour 'red 'blue 'green 'red) should be 'OneColourOccurs
;; (check-colour 'red 'blue 'yellow 'green) should be 'NothingCorrect

(define (check-colour target1 target2 guess1 guess2)
  (cond
    [(and (symbol=? target1 guess1) (symbol=? target2 guess2)) 'Perfect]
    [(or (symbol=? target1 guess1) (symbol=? target2 guess2)) 'OneColourAtCorrectPosition]
    [(or (symbol=? target1 guess2) (symbol=? target2 guess1)) 'OneColourOccurs]
    [else 'NothingCorrect]))

;; EXAMPLES AS TESTS:
(symbol=? (check-colour 'red 'blue 'red 'blue) 'Perfect)
(symbol=? (check-colour 'red 'blue 'red 'green) 'OneColourAtCorrectPosition)
(symbol=? (check-colour 'red 'blue 'green 'red) 'OneColourOccurs)
(symbol=? (check-colour 'red 'blue 'yellow 'green) 'NothingCorrect)
